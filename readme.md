# CheckYo'Self

By: Noah Gibson

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use if semantic HTML, clean & organized CSS styles, dry JavaScript using localStorage to persist data. This comp is designed to create a list of tasks that can be checked off and removed from the dom and local storage.

This was a tough project for me. The JS skills were all supposed to build on eachother in order to successfully complete the project. I felt however that there was a large disconnect between Idea box and this project. That made completing the tasks of persisting cards using the information stored in local storage difficult. Adding in a dynamic list of elements inside the card was also challenging.
